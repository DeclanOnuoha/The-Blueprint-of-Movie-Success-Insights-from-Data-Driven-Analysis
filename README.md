## 1. INTRODUCTION
The film industry is a global powerhouse, generating over $90 billion in annual revenue, yet the formula for a movie’s success remains far from guaranteed. Even with significant investments sometimes exceeding $200 million and the involvement of A-list talent, many films fail to meet financial or critical expectations. While factors like budget, cast, genre, release timing, and marketing are widely considered important, their true impact can only be understood through rigorous data analysis.

This project takes a data-driven approach to uncover what truly contributes to a movie's success. By analyzing historical data from more than 5,000 films released between 2000 and 2024, the objective is to surface meaningful patterns and trends that can support smarter decision-making. These insights aim to assist studios, producers, and streaming platforms in navigating an increasingly competitive and digitally-driven entertainment landscape with greater confidence and clarity.

## 2. GOAL
The aim of this project is to uncover and analyze the key factors that contribute to a movie’s success. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, the project seeks to provide clear, evidence-based insights into what truly influences a film’s performance. These insights are intended to support studios, producers, and marketing teams in making more informed decisions and optimizing their strategies for future releases.
